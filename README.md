Description: This Flask application provides a basic chatbot interface. Users can input text queries, and the application processes them using the ask_gemini function (assumed to be defined elsewhere). The chatbot's response is displayed, and optionally spoken aloud using the pyttsx3 library.


Dependencies:
* Flask
* pyttsx3 (optional for text-to-speech)
